# wlasso

The goal of this repository is two-fold: 

- To put publicly available the **R package** `wlasso`. This package allows to fit linear and logistic regression models to complex survey data.
- The R code of the **simulation study** that analyzes the performance of replicate weights' methods to define training and test sets to select optimal LASSO regression models is also available.

Note that all the repository can be **downloaded** from `Code > Download ZIP`.

## R package - wlasso

The R package related to the paper is available in the folder `wlasso`. File `usage-package.R` provides an example of usage of the package functions. Data available in the folder `example-data` can be used to reproduce the examples proposed in the file `usage-package.R`.

## R code of the simulation study

All the R code needed to reproduce the results obtained in the simulation study of the paper is available in the folder `R code - simulation study`.
