# R code - Simulation Study

In this folder you can find the R code to reproduce the simulation study and the corresponding results. 

In order to run the simulation study, the folder needs to be downloaded and run the scripts `exe-sim.R` (to obtain the results of the simulations) and `exe-results.R` (to obtain the graphics and numerical summaries of the results) in R.

Each folder and document in this folder contains the following information:

## R code

- `exe-sim.R:` code that need to be run in order to run the simulation study and reproduce the results.
- `exe-results.R:` code that need to be run in order to plot the results and obtained the graphics saved in the "Graphics" folder.
- **Functions:** all the functions applied in the simulation study are available.
- **Supporting Information - Cluster effect:** the R code to reproduce the numberical results shown as supporting material is available in this folder.
- **Computation_times:** R code to analyze computation times of different replicate weights methods to select the tuning parameter for LASSO regression models for complex survey data. 


## Results

- **Results:** in this folder, you can find the instructions to obtain the results from the simulation study.
- **Graphics:** all the graphics obtained based on the results of the simulation study can be found in this folder.
- **Tables:** numerical results of the simulation study.
