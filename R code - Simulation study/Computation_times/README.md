# Computation times

In this folder there is available the code use to analyze the computation times of the Jacknife Repeated Replication (JKn), 
design-based cross-validation (dCV) and Rescaling Bootstrap (Bootstrap).

The users that want to analyze the computation times of these methods in their computers, can run the code available in `comp_times.R`.

The files `times_res_linear_scenario1.RData`, `times_res_linear_scenario2.RData`, `times_res_logistic_scenario1.RData` and 
`times_res_logistic_scenario2.RData` contain the computation times based on the simulated data. 
All computations were performed in (64 bit) R 4.2.0 (R Core Team 2022) and a workstation equipped with 32GB of RAM, an Intel i7-8700 processor (3.20 Ghz) 
and Windows 10 operating system.
